**Example: julia RKTK.jl search 2 4 10**

- Within the RKTK.jl file, the search function is called with the provided arguments:

2 as the order of the Runge-Kutta method to be searched
4 as the number of stages of the Runge-Kutta method to be searched
10 as the precision of the search (the number of significant digits)

- Create an instance of an RKOC optimizer with the specified parameters and an objective function
- The optimizer runs an optimization algorithm to find the Runge-Kutta method that minimizes the 
  objective function, using the provided parameters as input.
